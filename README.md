This module permits contant- and variable-rate pitch-shifting and
time-stretching of speech. It is a wrapper around the `parselmouth` [1]
wrapper around the Praat [2] implementation of TD-PSOLA [3]. Pitch-shifting
is performed by providing a numpy array of target pitch values equally spaced
over time. Variable-rate time stretching uses forced phoneme alignment via
[`pypar`](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/pypar).

If you need to extract pitch features or phoneme alignments, see
[`torchcrepe`](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe) for pitch estimation
and [`pyfoal`](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/pyfoal) for forced alignment.
If you only want to perform pitch-shifting, you do not need to extract
forced alignments. If you want to do variable-rate time stretching, you do not
need to perform pitch estimation.


## Installation

`pip install psola`


## Usage

If you want to perform pitch-shifting or time-stretching on audio already
loaded into memory, use `psola.vocode`. If you want to do this with audio
saved in a file, use `psola.from_file`. You can use `psola.to_file` or
`psola.from_file_to_file` to save the results to a file. To process many
files at once with multiprocessing, use `psola.from_files_to_files`.
Each of these functions is documented below. The command-line interface
wraps the arguments of `psola.from_files_to_files` and is described in
the next section.
